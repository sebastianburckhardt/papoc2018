<p style="text-align: justify;"> 

Consistency is one of the fundamental issues of distributed computing. There
are many competing consistency models, with subtly different power in
principle. In practice, the well-known the Consistency-Availability-Partition
Tolerance trade-off translates to difficult choices between fault tolerance,
performance, and programmability. The issues and trade-offs are particularly
vexing at scale, with a large number of processes or a large shared database,
and in the presence of high latency and failure-prone networks. It is clear
that there is no one universally best solution. 
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Possible approaches cover the
whole spectrum between strong and eventual consistency. Strong consistency
(total ordering via, for example, linearizability or serializability) provides
familiar and intuitive semantics but requires slow and fragile synchronization
and coordination overheads. The unlimited parallelism allowed by weaker models
such as eventual consistency promises high performance, but divergence and
conflicts make it difficult to ensure useful application invariants, and
meta-data is hard to keep in check. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
The research and development communities
are actively exploring intermediate models (replicated data types, monotonic
programming, CRDTs, LVars, causal consistency, red-blue consistency, invariant-
and proof-based systems, etc.), designed to improve efficiency,
programmability, and overall operation without negatively impacting
scalability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This workshop aims to investigate the principles and practice of consistency models for large-scale, fault-tolerant, distributed shared data systems.
It will
bring together theoreticians and practitioners from different horizons: system
development, distributed algorithms, concurrency, fault tolerance, databases,
language and verification, including both academia and industry.
</p>

<h2> Submission Guidelines: </h2>
<!-- <p style="text-align: justify;">
Please see <a href="submission.html">the submission page</a> for information.

</p> -->

<p style="text-align: justify;">

We solicit proposals for contributed talks. We recommend preparing proposals of
2 pages, written in English and in either plain text or PDF format.  However,
we will accept longer proposals or submissions to other conferences, under the
understanding that PC members are only expected to read the first two pages of
such longer submissions.

Authors will have the opportunity to choose if they want their
papers published in ACM Digital Library (with papers from other EuroSys
workshops).

<p> All paper submissions will be handled
via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=papoc2018">Easychair</a>.
